## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension
- [Create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/)

### What I learned

I struggled a bit with props sending from one component to another, and properly handling them. Forgot about top down data flow, so i have to fix it, that the parent component will handle state. After a long nights i finished this project successfully.
I have learned how to manage props, sending them from one component to another, top down data flow, onClick, onChange etc..

### Continued development

I´ll continue to become better working with React.
